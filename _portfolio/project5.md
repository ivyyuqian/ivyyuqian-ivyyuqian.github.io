Implemented Transformer encoder via NLP and DL. Preprocessed data (punctuation removal/word encoding/outliers 
handling/embedding layer with positional encoding). Built and trained models (multi-head attention layer for attention score computing/regularization techniques). Achieved 93% accuracy, outperforming LSTM models and precisely predicting test reviews.
